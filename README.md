The purpose of this repository is to have a public entry point for people interested in a suite of modelling tools for streamflow forecasting. 

# Onboarding guide for streamflow forecasting software tools

# Capabilities

This documentation introduces a set of software tools for ensemble streamflow forecasting techniques. The core is written in C++, but in practice users access the features via packages in R, python, or Matlab.

An overview of the tools is available [there](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/LWF/Areas/Water-resources/Assessing-water-resources/WIRADA/Data-and-tools), under the section "Flood and short-term streamflow forecasting"
