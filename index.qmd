title: "Streamflow Forecasting"
---

This is a public entry point for a suite of hydrologic ensemble forecasting modelling tools developed in Australia over the past decade. Most scientific modelling features were authored by the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au). While designed with unique features for _ensemble_ streamflow forecasting, these tools can equally be used in _non-ensemble_ simulation mode for other, "traditional" semi-distributed hydrologic modelling.

# Applications

Some of the modelling tools are used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) to provide the [7-day Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/7daystreamflow) service. An overview of the research and outcomes in streamflow forecasting of the research alliance between the Bureau and CSIRO is available [at this page](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/LWF/Areas/Water/Assessing-water-resources/WIRADA/Research/Water-forecasting).

More recent versions of the tools are also used for further research, development and applications. The core modelling features are usually native (C++) libraries, accessed seamlessly by user from R, Python and Matlab.

The [documentation](./documentation.qmd) page has links to sample modelling workflows in `R` and `Python` that hydrologic modellers can browse through to get an idea of the features.

# Installation

Installation packages are available for Windows, Debian/Ubuntu Linux, and MacOSX. They currently cannot _all_ be made publicly downloadable, but access for evaluation or research purposes can be arranged. Contact [David Robertson](https://people-my.csiro.au/r/d/david-robertson) at [david.robertson@csiro.au](mailto:david.robertson@csiro.au) and/or [jean-michel.perraud@csiro.au](mailto:jean-michel.perraud@csiro.au). Then follow the instructions at the [Installation](./installation.qmd) page.

# Architecture

The core of the toolset is written in C++ for execution speed, but in practice users mostly access the features via packages in R, python, or Matlab.

Besides building upon established third party open source software, some components of our stack are also open source. See [csiro-hydroinformatics](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics) on GitHub, for instance the [uchronia time series handling module](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/uchronia-time-series).

The [developer page](./doc/developer.qmd) also contains more detailed technical information on the software stack.
