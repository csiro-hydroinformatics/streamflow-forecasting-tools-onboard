title: "Streamflow Forecasting"
---

This site is a public entry point for a suite of hydrologic ensemble forecasting modelling tools developed by the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) over the past decade. While designed with unique features for ensemble streamflow forecasting, they can equally be used in non-ensemble simulation mode for other semi-distributed hydrologic modelling.

# Applications

A subset of the tools is used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to provide the [7-day Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/7daystreamflow) service. 

More recent versions of the tools are also used for research and development. The core modelling features are usually native (C++) libraries, accessed seamlessly by user from R, Python and Matlab.

Hands-on hydrologic modellers can browse through some [sample modelling workflows in R package vignettes](./doc/samples/sample_workflows_r.md) to get an idea of the features.

# Installation

Packages are available for installation on Windows, Debian/Ubuntu Linux, and MacOSX. They currently cannot all be made publicly downloadable, but access for evaluation or research purposes can usually easily be arranged upon request. Contact [David Robertson](https://people-my.csiro.au/r/d/david-robertson) at [david.robertson@csiro.au](mailto:david.robertson@csiro.au) and/or [jean-michel.perraud@csiro.au](mailto:jean-michel.perraud@csiro.au). Then follow the instructions at the [Installation](./installation.qmd) page.

# Architecture

![Software stack](./img/architecture_poster.png "Software stack overview")

This documentation introduces a set of software tools for ensemble streamflow forecasting techniques. The core is written in C++, but in practice users access the features via packages in R, python, or Matlab. 

An overview of the research and outcomes is available [at this page](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/LWF/Areas/Water/Assessing-water-resources/WIRADA/Research/Water-forecasting).

A high level description of the software stack with the main components follows. This stack is built mostly on open source software; see [csiro-hydroinformatics](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics), notably [uchronia-time-series](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/uchronia-time-series). We also intend to open source the semi-distributed modelling engine.

# Getting started

In R you can access samples via vignettes in the packages:

```R
library(swift)
library(uchronia)
browseVignettes('swift')
```

You can access the wider package documentation using the command `?swift`, and navigate down the page to the footer `[Package swift version 0.7.7 Index]` (yes, admitedly there should be an easier way...). Click on the `Index` hyperlink of that footer. Note that you will find a very long list of functions but functions postfixed `_R` should not be used as primary building blocks in your scripts.
