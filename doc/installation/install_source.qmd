title: "Installation: From source code"

["cruise-control" (restricted link)](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/SF/repos/cruise-control/browse) contains detailed instructions for building and maintaining the software stack from source.

Few people have this need in practice, and within this pool of people, most will have a particular platform and preference in development tools, so it is moot to document prescriptive steps here for now. That said, the build pipelines that exist for various operating systems may be a basis for documenting this in the future. Pending user needs.
