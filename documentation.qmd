Pointers to further technical documentation for using or developing features.

# Sample workflows for modellers

* [vignettes for the `swift` package](./doc/samples/sample_workflows_r.md)
* [jupyter notebooks for the python package `swift2`](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/swift-py-doc/notebooks/getting_started/)

# Technical references

## Packages documentations

* [python package swift2](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/swift-py-doc)
* The [uchronia time series API documentation](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/uchronia-ts-doc) combines the documentation of the python package `uchronia` with its C++ core.

The R packages contain function documentation, example snippets and so-called "vignettes". you can access vignettes in the packages for instance with:

```R
library(swift)
library(uchronia)
browseVignettes('swift')
```

You can access the wider package documentation using the command `?swift`, and see an index of the features by navigating down the page to the footer `[Package swift version 2.4.x Index]`. Click on the `Index` hyperlink of that footer. Note that you will find a very long list of functions, but note that functions postfixed `_R` should not be used as primary building blocks in your scripts.

## Build pipelines

The source code for Azure Devops pipelines are also available as of 2023-01 from github, for information purposes only. Their public availability may change in the future though.
